# KLS-based-structural-network
This repository provides codes for constructing KLS divergence-based structural similarity networks by assessing the distribution similarity of gray matter volume between brain regions and predicting individual fluid intelligence. 

# age_node
Age-related changes of node degree. 

# KLS_network
Structural MRI data preprocessing and KLS network construction.

# PLS_predict
Structural similarity networks predict individual fluid intelligence.
